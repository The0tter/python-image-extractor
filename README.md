# Python Image Extractor

This project was originally created to extract JPG's out of the Android Thumbdata3 format.

It is theoretically capable of extracting data from any file that contains multiple JPG's within.

## Usage

Usage is quite simple:

```bash
./extract.py --file thumbdata3
```

The script will then output to the same directory a bunch of JPG's. These are the files you are after.
